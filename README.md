## 📌 Overview

This project explores **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** between English and Vietnamese via two distinct approaches:

1. **Transformer From Scratch** – Custom implementation based on *"Attention is All You Need"* using PyTorch.
2. **Pretrained MarianMT** – Fine-tuning the pretrained `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-vi` model from Hugging Face on a bilingual corpus.

Both models are trained and evaluated using BLEU scores and sample output comparisons.

## 🔧 Model Approaches

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Transformer_Scratch.ipynb` | Implements a full Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch. |
| `Transformer_Pretrained.ipynb` | Fine-tunes a pretrained MarianMT model on the `ncduy/mt-en-vi` dataset. |

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krapsai/english-vietnamese-translation-transformers.git
cd english-vietnamese-translation-transformers

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or manually:
pip install torch transformers datasets sacrebleu

## 📁 Data Preparation

This project uses the publicly available dataset:

📦 Hugging Face – ncduy/mt-en-vi

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("ncduy/mt-en-vi")
print(dataset["train"][0])
```

You can replace this with any bilingual English–Vietnamese dataset, such as Tatoeba, IWSLT, or your own CSV file with english and vietnamese columns.
